/**
 * (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v,
 * you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:
 *                                      length = (v^2) / 2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a
 * in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length.
 *
 * Here is a sample run:
 *
 * In:          Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5 [Enter]
 * Out:         The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
